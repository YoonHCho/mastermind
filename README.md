# Mastermind Game

- Need to do: code clean up once app.js is working same as index.js
- UPDATE 4/28 WOP: created 2 classes Player and ManagePlayers. For reusability and to use OOP. Able to create Multi-player (however the current WOP is for a single player, just implemented feature to create multi-player).

index.js works as intended

1. user can guess 4 numbers
2. user can view history of guesses and their feedback
3. number of attempts remaining

testing with app.js for separation
